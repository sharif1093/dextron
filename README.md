# DEXTRON: DEXTerity enviRONment

This project offers a stochastic environment for simulating robot prosthetic hands grasping based on REAL human reaching trajectory data. Also, solutions based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (SAC method) and Deep RL and Imitation Learning (IL) are provided.


This project is based on [Digideep](https://github.com/sharif1093/digideep) project.
